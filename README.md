# DSA Learning Journey 🚀

Welcome to my **Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA)** repository! 🎯 I am currently learning DSA to enhance my problem-solving skills. This repository is structured in a way that helps me organize my learning by topics such as **Arrays, Sorting, Recursion, Graphs, Dynamic Programming**, and more.

I am currently learning **Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA)** and following **[Take U Forward's A2Z DSA Sheet](https://takeuforward.org/strivers-a2z-dsa-course/strivers-a2z-dsa-course-sheet-2)** to systematically cover all topics. Most of my solutions are implemented in **Java**, but I sometimes use **Python** as well. This repository is a work in progress, and I keep updating it as I learn new concepts and solve more problems. 🎯

I solve problems on different platforms while maintaining well-structured code files categorized into different folders.
